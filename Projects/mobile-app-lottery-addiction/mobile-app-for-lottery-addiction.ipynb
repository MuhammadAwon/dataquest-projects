    "The goal of this project is to develop a mobile app that helps lottery addicts estimate their chances of winning. The app will be created by a team of engineers from a medical institute that focuses on preventing and treating gambling addictions. Our role is to build the app's logical core and calculate probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first version of the app, we will focus on the [6/49 lottery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotto_6/49) and develop functions that allow users to answer critical questions, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the probability of winning the big prize with a single ticket?\n",
    "- What is the probability of winning the big prize if we play 40 different tickets (or any other number)?\n",
    "- What is the probability of having at least five, four, three, or two winning numbers on a single ticket?\n",
    "\n",
    "We will analyze historical data from the national 6/49 lottery game in Canada to accomplish this task. [The data set](https://www.kaggle.com/datascienceai/lottery-dataset) contains information on 3,665 drawings dating from 1982 to 2018. By analyzing this data and developing accurate probability models, we hope to create an app that provides lottery addicts with the information they need to make informed decisions and avoid developing addiction.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "As explained, our goal in this project is to develop a mobile app that can help lottery addicts better estimate their chances of winning. To achieve this, we need to calculate probabilities and combinations repeatedly. Hence, we'll start by writing two essential functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A factorial function that calculates factorials.\n",
    "- A combination function that calculates combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula to calculate factorials is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$n! = n \\times (n-1) \\times (n-2) \\times \\cdots \\times 2 \\times 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "For the 6/49 lottery, six numbers are drawn from a set of 49 numbers that range from 1 to 49, and the drawing is done without replacement. This means that once a number is drawn, it's not put back in the set.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the number of combinations when we're sampling without replacement and taking only k objects from a group of n objects, we can use the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "${n C k} = \\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$"

    "## One-ticket Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "Our next step is to build a function that can calculate the probability of winning the big prize in the 6/49 lottery. To win the big prize, a player's ticket must match all six numbers drawn from a set of 49 numbers ranging from 1 to 49. For instance, if a player's ticket has the numbers {13, 22, 24, 27, 42, 44}, they only win the big prize if the drawn numbers are {13, 22, 24, 27, 42, 44}. If any one number is different, they lose.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first version of our app, we want users to be able to calculate the probability of winning the big prize with the various numbers they play on a single ticket. A player selects six numbers out of 49 to make a single ticket. To achieve this, we will create a function that takes a Python list of six different numbers between 1 and 49 as input and calculates the probability of winning the big prize.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before building the function, we have discussed some specific details with the engineering team of the medical institute, which must be considered while writing the function:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The user inputs six different numbers from 1 to 49 inside the app.\n",
    "- Under the hood, the six numbers will come as a Python list, which will serve as the single input to our function.\n",
    "- The engineering team has requested that the function print the probability value in an easy-to-understand way, suitable for users who have no prior probability training."
