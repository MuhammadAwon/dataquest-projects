# Data Science Projects

These are the guided projects that I have worked on through the [DataQuest](https://www.dataquest.io/) platform. I'm still going through the curriculum of the [Data Scientist](https://www.dataquest.io/path/data-scientist/) career path and I will keep updating the repository with new projects.
